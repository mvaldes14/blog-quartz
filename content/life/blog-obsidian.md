It's been nearly a year since I started using Obsidian for almost everything from posts, notes, tracking tasks and work efforts. I have been tempted to publish and write everything within the tool or Neovim with the Obisidian plugin.

I looked at Obsidian Publish, which is a service that allows you to generate a site from your documents, but I'm already paying for Obsidian Sync and I tend to host my own stuff. While looking around, I found [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) which is an alternative that looks exactly like the publishing service but with some extra layers that you can customize.

So here we are... if you are reading this post, it's pretty much everything inside of Obsidian or Neovim and a simple git push generates the site, the content is synced over without me having to manually move stuff around. It has the benefit of having links that should be relevant within posts that relate or link to each other, which is a great feature used for my learning notes. The graph view is included by default but to be honest, I don't quite use that even in the native tool, so being a custom solution, you can add or remove components.

Finally having something with a better search engine, tag dedicated pages and a simpler design makes me feel like I finally reached a good spot for my blog platform. Somewhere in my to-do list, I was going to investigate how to add pagination, a tag page and include a way to search which doing in Astro seems kind of easy to do but we engineers are lazy by nature so Quartz pretty much solved everything for me.

But then again, this is the third time I re-do the blog, so time will tell.
