After a year of immersing myself in the world of Obsidian, I've grown accustomed to using it for everything from notes and posts to task tracking and work documentation. The allure of publishing directly from Obsidian or Neovim with the Obisidian plugin was strong, but I eventually stumbled upon [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), an alternative that shares many similarities with Obsidian Publish while offering additional customization options.

Quartz provides a solution for generating a site from your documents without the need for additional services like Obsidian Sync, which I already subscribe to. With just a simple git push, my content is synced and published, eliminating the need for manual file transfers. The platform also offers links that connect related posts, a feature I find particularly useful for organizing my learning notes.

One of the standout features of Quartz is its graph view, which can be customized to suit your needs. While I don't utilize this feature extensively within Obsidian itself, it's a valuable addition for those who do. The platform also boasts a more powerful search engine, dedicated tag pages, and a cleaner design that has made me feel like I've finally found the perfect blogging solution.

In the past, I had plans to implement pagination, create tag pages, and add a search function on my blog. However, with Quartz, these features are already included, making it an ideal choice for lazy engineers like myself. That being said, this is the third time I've redesigned my blog, so only time will tell if this solution sticks.
