Welcome to my Personal Site! Here, I will share my experiences as I work on various projects or learn new skills, often inspired by what catches my interest. Most of the time, it's just me exploring exciting and cool topics.

A bit about myself: My name is Miguel, born in Mexico, and I am an Electronic Engineer by profession who found a deep passion for software. The love affair with computers began when my parents brought home a PC during the era of Jill of the Jungle. Needless to say, I was on a journey from an early age. Fortunately, I enjoy what I do for a living and am captivated by the IT world as a whole.

I'm a video game enthusiast, with preferences for First-Person Shooters (FPS), Hack & Slash games, and of course Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs). Some of my favorite titles are Diablo II and DoTA.
